# weather-dashboard

## Description
This project consists of an index.html file that has a CSS and JS file linked as well. jQuery is used as well. I created the containers in HTML and used the OpenWeatherMap API to obtain weather data from searched cities. The cities that are searched by the user will be listed below the "Get Weather" button, and can be clicked to easily access weather from that city.
